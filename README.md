# netlogo_web_api_extension
Here, I have made a small proof of concept extension for NetLogo. It is based on the sample-scala extension that comes with NetLogo 6.0-M5 and needs the same version to run. The extension embeds a jetty server with a lift application in order to provide an API endpoint. I have done this because of the existence of some personal .NET projects that could benefit from interoperability with NetLogo and I saw this as the simplest way to achieve interoperability
